              <h1>PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY</h1>
              <p>The owners and operators of this Internet site and related applications uses an encryption protocol to encrypt communications. The protocol is called Transport layer Security (TLS), although formerly it was known as Secure Socket layer. This protocol secures communications by using what’s known as an asymmetric public key infrastructure. This type of security system uses two different keys to encrypt communications between two parties: The private key - this key is controlled by the owner of a website, and it’s kept, as the reader may have speculated, private. This key lives on a web server and is used to decrypt information encrypted by the public key. The public key - this key is available to everyone who wants to interact with the server in a way that’s secure. Information that’s encrypted by the public key can only be decrypted by the private key.</p>
              <p>The owners and operators of this Internet site and related application, agree to make a commercially reasonable effort to only give IP based access which can called only by our system and to prevent database query from outside our system.</p>
              <p>The owners and operators of this Internet site and related application, agree to make a commercially reasonable effort to uses SSL pinning, meaning that the owners and operators of this Internet site and related application will make a commercially reasonable effort to verify the server&#39;s SSL certificate against a predefined or &quot;pinned&quot; certificate or public key. Instead of relying solely on the default trust store provided by the operating system, the app explicitly specifies the trusted certificate or public key it expects the server to present during the SSL handshake.</p>
              <p>WE DO NOT SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH OTHER PARTIES UNLESS THERE IS A CONTRACTUAL OR STATUTORY REQUIREMENT TO DO SO.  PURSUANT TO SAID CONTRACTUAL OR STATUTORY REQUIREMENT THE OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF THIS INTERNET SITE MAY SELL, RENT OR TRADE YOUR PERSONAL DATA.  WE MAY DISCLOSE YOUR DATA TO SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO RENDER SERVICES TO US OR TO YOU ON OUR BEHALF, FOR EXAMPLE: MAILING HOUSES.  WE MAY DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION IF REQUIRED BY LAW OR TO ENFORCE OUR LEGAL RIGHTS.  WE MAY ENGAGE WITH THIRD PARTIES WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA TO THIRD PARTIES AND WE WILL MAKE A COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE ATTEMPT TO PROHIBIT THIRD PARTIES FROM SELLING YOUR PERSONAL DATA WE HAVE SHARED WITH THEM, UNLESS PROPER CONSENT IS ABTAINED.</p>
              <p>THE DATA WE HOLD ABOUT YOU IS STORED IN SECURE SERVERS WITH APPROPRIATE COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE FIREWALLS AND WE USE DATA PROTECTION SOFTWARE APPLIED ON CLOUD LEVEL TO PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL DATA.</p>
